I am a PhD student at the [Cognitive Neurogenetics Lab](https://cng-lab.github.io/) situated at the [MPI CBS (Leipzig, Germany)](http://www.cbs.mpg.de/) and [INM-7, Research Center Jülich (Jülich, Germany)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-7/EN/Home/home_node.html), under the supervision of [Dr. Sofie Valk](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-7/EN/valk_s.html). Previously, I have studied medicine at the [Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Mashhad, Iran)](https://www.mums.ac.ir/index.php/en/), followed by a two-year research position at the [Institute of Medical Science and Technology at Shahid Beheshti University (Tehran, Iran)](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/Research_Institutes/MedicalSci/Pages/default.aspx) under the supervision of [Dr. Masoud Tahmasian](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-7/EN/Tahmasian_m.html), during which I studied the structural and functional brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders using coordinate-based meta-analyses and neuroimaging techniques.

My research is generally focused on using computational neuroscience techniques on neuroimaging data to study the low-dimensional structural and functional properties of the brain and their links to behavior and psychiatric disorders. In my PhD, I focus on the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain and its relation to large-scale brain organization during development, its disruption in psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia), as well as functional consequences of its inter-individual differences and intra-individual dynamics.

I am also interested in open and reproducible science, as well as programming and developing and improving tools for analyzing neuroimaging data.

In my spare time, I watch TV shows and movies, cook, play video games, and read books.
