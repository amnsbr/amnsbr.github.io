I have received my M.D. from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Mashhad, Iran), and I'm currently working as a non-resident researcher in the Institute of Medical Science and Technology at Shahid Beheshti University (Tehran, Iran), doing neuroimaging research under the supervision of <a href="http://en.sbu.ac.ir/Research_Institutes/MedicalSci/Pages/Dr.-Masoud-Tahmasian.aspx">Dr. Masoud Tahmasian</a>.

I use coordinate-based meta-analysis and functional and structural neuroimaging methods to better understand the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the normal functioning of the human brain. I am in particular interested is using computational neuroscience methods to do model-driven research on psychiatric disorders, i.e., computational psychiatry. In addition, I am interested in developing and improving tools and methods of analyzing neuroimaging data.

In my spare time, I enjoy programming and building small web/desktop applications, cooking, playing video games, and watching TV shows.
