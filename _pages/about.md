I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Neurobiosocial Group](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/neurobiosocial) led by [Dr. Sofie Valk](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/valk/1433352) at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](http://www.cbs.mpg.de/) and [Research Center JÃ¼lich (INM-7)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-7/EN/Home/home_node.html). 

My research is focused on using computational neuroscience techniques on neuroimaging data to study the low-dimensional functional and structural properties of the brain and their links to behavior and psychiatric disorders. I am also interested in open and reproducible science, as well as developing and improving tools for analyzing brain data, with a focus on computational modeling and meta-analyses.

Previously, I have studied medicine at the [Mashhad University of Medical Sciences](https://www.mums.ac.ir/index.php/en/) (2011-2019), had a research stay at the [Institute of Medical Science and Technology at Shahid Beheshti University](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/Research_Institutes/MedicalSci/Pages/default.aspx) (2019-2021) under the supervision of [Dr. Masoud Tahmasian](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-7/EN/Tahmasian_m.html), and completed my PhD at the [Neurobiosocial Group](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/neurobiosocial) (2021-2025) under the supervision of [Dr. Sofie Valk](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/valk/1433352) and Prof. Simon Eickhoff.
