I am a PhD student at the [Cognitive Neurogenetics Lab](https://cng-lab.github.io/) led by [Dr. Sofie Valk](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-7/EN/valk_s.html) and situated at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](http://www.cbs.mpg.de/) and [Research Center JÃ¼lich (INM-7)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-7/EN/Home/home_node.html). 

My research is focused on using computational neuroscience techniques on neuroimaging data to study the low-dimensional structural and functional properties of the brain and their links to behavior and psychiatric disorders. I am also interested in open and reproducible science, as well as developing and improving tools for analyzing brain data. 

Previously, I have studied medicine at the [Mashhad University of Medical Sciences](https://www.mums.ac.ir/index.php/en/) (2011-2019), followed by a research stay at the [Institute of Medical Science and Technology at Shahid Beheshti University](http://en.sbu.ac.ir/Research_Institutes/MedicalSci/Pages/default.aspx) (2019-2021) under the supervision of [Dr. Masoud Tahmasian](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-7/EN/Tahmasian_m.html).
