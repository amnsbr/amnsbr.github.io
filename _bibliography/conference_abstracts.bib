abstract = {Introduction: The response to noxious stimuli can be facilitated by observing another person in pain [1]. This effect has been suggested to result from a sensorimotor resonance through the mirror neurons, or an increased level of arousal [2,3]. In this study, we used mediation effect parametric mapping (MEPM) to understand which regions of the brain mediate this effect. Method: We scanned 21 pain-free volunteers (10 females; mean age = 25.2±4.1) using fMRI while performing a vicarious pain facilitation paradigm. In each trial (N=24) participants observed neutral, fearful, or painful facial expressions, before receiving a shock that elicited the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR), an objective indicative of nociceptive processing in the spinal cord and recorded their subjective pain ratings. We used multi-level MEPM to test the mediation effect of trial-by-trial voxel-wise brain activity in response to shocks for the relationship between the emotional valence of the observed facial expressions and pain ratings or NFR responses, after FDR correction (p<0.05, k=10). Results: The inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, paracentral lobule, cerebellum, and anterior cingulate cortex were significant mediators of vicarious facilitation of pain after observing both fearful and painful facial expressions. With the painful facial expressions, more widespread regions of the brain mediated this effect, additionally including precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, the temporoparietal junction, superior parietal lobule, insula and thalamus. The increase in NFR after observing painful facial expressions was mediated by the putamen and superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions: The vicarious facilitation of pain is mediated by regions that are part of the human motor neuron system, or are involved in affective theory of mind, in addition to the regions involved in the emotional modulation of pain.},

abstract = {Late life depression (LLD) is turning into a health concern with the aging of the population. Its unique presentation with somatic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction highlights the need to study LLD as a distinct disease process from depression in younger adults. Numerous functional and structural neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of LLD, but have reported inconsistent results. In this study, we aimed to identify locations in the brain that were most consistently altered across the existing studies.Method We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge for relevant studies published until July 2019 and retrieved 2657 potential studies. All whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comparing patients with LLD and healthy controls (HC) were included. Two authors independently extracted the data and the peak coordinates of the significant foci. Coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using the revised activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method according to the current best-practice guidelines.Results We identified 23 eligible studies (eight VBM, one PET, five resting-state fMRI, and ten task-based fMRI) including 516 LLD patients and 490 HCs. No significant converging structural and functional brain abnormalities between LLD and HC (27 experiments) was observed after controlling for multiple comparisons using a stringent cluster-level family-wise error correction (pcFWE = 0.680). Additionally, the meta-analysis on LLD > HC with 13 experiments (pcFWE = 0.069) and LLD < HC with 14 experiments (pcFWE = 0.357) revealed no significant convergent abnormalities.Conclusions The lack of convergence across individual studies might be related to the differences in experimental designs and statistical approaches, heterogeneity of clinical populations, and small sample sizes of the individual studies. Currently, there is not enough evidence available to pinpoint a specific underlying neural pathology associated with LLD.},

abstract = {Stress affects working memory based on plenty of evidences and in most cases its effect is impairing. It seems that severity of this effect depends on multiple factors. One of the possible factors may be personality traits. Current study is designed to examine probable vulnerability of some personality traits to the effect of social stress on working memory. In this study, performance of individuals in working memory test will be compared before and after the treatment with Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Individuals' personality will be evaluated based on NEO-FFI (NEO-Five Factor Inventory). Salivary Cortisol levels will be measured before and after the treatment as a marker of HPAA (Hypothalamic-Pituatury-Adrenal axis) activity. Finally, we will analyze the correlation between data obtained from working memory test and NEO-FFI.},

abstract ={<b>Introduction:</b> Glioblastoma multiforem (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and it is important to identify biomarkers that can predict its prognosis. The aim of this study was to systematically review the prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with GBM.<br> <b>Materials and Methods:</b> PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched until February 2016 using the following search strategy: neutrophil* AND lymphocyte* AND (glioma OR glioblastoma OR astrocytoma).  Two authors independently screened the retrieved articles to find all the studies that evaluated the prognostic value of NLR in GBM patients. Data extraction and quality assessment for the included studies was performed independently by two authors. Studies using Cox proportional hazards model to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with low and high values of NLR were included in the meta-analysis.<br> <b>Results:</b> Six studies and 827 patients were included in the systematic review. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary outcome in two studies. One study identified lower values of NLR as a significant predictor of better PFS, but the other one showed the opposite effect. Performing a meta-analysis was not possible on these two studies. The primary outcome in six studies was OS, four of which reported NLR as a significant prognostic marker. Pooled univariate hazard ratios (HRs) of two studies for predicting OS was 1.903 (95% CI: 1.420-2.551) and pooled multivariate HRs of four studies for predicting OS was 1.564 (95% CI: 1.208-2.024). Negligible heterogeneity was observed between studies.<br> <b>Conclusion:</b> Overall survival of GBM patients can be predicted using NLR, but its application as a predictive marker of PFS is uncertain. },

Quality of studies was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist for prognostic studies.<br> <b>Results:</b> Eight studies (303 patients) were included. In six studies all the patients had recurrent glioblastoma and in one study patients with grade III glioma were included as well. OS and PFS were the outcomes of interest in 7 and 8 studies, respectively. To evaluate the prognostic value of cerebral blood volume, six studies performed log-rank survival analysis and five studies used univariate or multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, three of which reported hazard ratios. Cerebral blood volume was reported as a significant predictor of OS and PFS in 4 studies (173 patients).<br> <b>Conclusions:</b> The conflicting results of included studies indicate that the application of cerebral blood volume as a prognostic factor in glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab is uncertain.

title = {Characterising the cortical gradients of laminar thickness similarity}, 
abstract ={The cerebral cortex consists of distinct layers with unique properties and functions. Previous work has shown that the laminar architecture of cortical regions varies in a spatially ordered fashion along a ‘‘sensory-fugal’’ axis, with decreasing laminar differentiation from the unimodal to transmodal areas. Indeed, the “Structural Model” proposes that the isocortex can be divided into regions with comparable laminar structures, or cortical types, with links to their connections, plasticity and development. In this study, we leveraged the BigBrain map of cortical layers and used a non-linear manifold learning approach to probe along which organisational axes laminar structure covaries in the cortex.},

abstract ={
    The cerebral cortex consists of layers with unique properties that vary along the cortical mantle. The Structural Model proposes that similarity of regions in their laminar structure is related to the strength and direction of their connectivity, in addition to their degree of plasticity and disease vulnerability. In addition, there are several subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons which have specific laminar and regional distributions, which may relate to the laminar structure variations. Here, we quantitatively characterized the main axis of laminar thickness covariance, leveraging a deep-learning based approximation of six cortical layers in the BigBrain, and studied its relation to connectivity, disease vulnerability and microcircuitry.
    We found that the main axis of cortical laminar thickness covariance differentiates the dominance of infragranular and supragranular layers, spanning from frontal to temporal, occipital and parietal regions. In support of the Structural Model, we showed that regions with similar laminar structure tend to connect together. In addition, regions with more prominent infragranular layers have higher hierarchy, i.e., influence the activity in other regions, which may relate to the laminar pattern of feedback/-forward connections. We also showed that disease vulnerability of regions relate to their laminar structure, as the main axis of laminar thickness covariance was correlated with the main axis of disease co-alteration. However, we found no significant correlation between the main axes of covariance in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes and the main axis of laminar thickness covariance.

title = {Organization of laminar thickness covariance in the human cortex}, 
abstract ={The cerebral cortex is made up of roughly six horizontally organized layers with unique cytoarchitectural properties distributed across the cortical mantle. This gradual variation of laminar structure is a fundamental principle of cortical organization. The similarity of regions in their laminar structure, with roots in development, is suggested to relate to the likelihood, strength and direction of their connectivity. Current accounts of laminar structure variation are mainly based on theory-driven approaches in which histological samples of the cortex are labeled into discrete types based on visual inspection of laminar features. Here, leveraging on a data-driven map of the six cortical layers in the BigBrain, we aimed to quantitatively characterize the gradual variation of laminar structure in the cortex. We identified an organizational axis of laminar thickness covariance which differentiated the dominance of infragranular and supragranular layer thickness and in general followed a rostro-caudal trajectory. This axis was co-aligned with the cortical hierarchy such that infragranular-dominant regions towards the rostral pole of the cortex were overall higher up this functional hierarchy. Furthermore, laminar thickness variation was linked to connectivity, with regions with similar laminar thickness showed higher likelihood and strength of connectivity. Laminar thickness covariance was also related to structural covariance, reflecting shared developmental/maturational and genetics effects of the regions with similar laminar structure, which hints at developmental origins of laminar structure variability. In sum, we describe the organization of layer-wise thickness covariation in the cortical mantle and how it relates to structure and function.},

abstract = {Introduction. Adolescence is a critical period of development which involves substantial macro- and microscale changes in the brain, including maturation of cortical microcircuits (Sydnor, 2021). Measuring properties of cortical microcircuitry in the developing brain is challenging, and the evidence supporting its maturation is mainly based on animal and post-mortem studies with limited in-vivo human evidence (Ghisleni, 2015; Larsen, 2022; Perica, 2022). Whole-brain dynamical modeling is a promising approach that enables mechanistic inferences about hidden brain features, such as estimated properties of cortical microcircuits (Park, 2021). Here, we used dynamical modeling to study age-related changes of whole-brain model parameters during adolescence. <br>Methods. We studied adolescents from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (N = 627, 364 females, age: 15.2±2.4 [10-19]). The T1w, rs-fMRI and DWI imaging data were preprocessed using FreeSurfer, fMRIPrep, micapipe and in-house scripts, resulting in the following for each subject: 1) structural connectome as the normalized number of streamlines between pairs of regions, 2) empirical functional connectome (FC) as the correlation of BOLD signals between regions, and 3) empirical functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) matrix, calculated by correlation of FC patterns between the time windows in time-resolved FC, parcellated based on the Schaefer-100 scheme. Next, we used a whole-brain dynamical modeling approach (Wong and Wang, 2006; Deco, 2014) to estimate subject-specific hidden parameters of cortical microcircuits by performing model inversion (Fig. 1). The model consists of ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in each region, with a set of stochastic differential equations governing their dynamics, and regions connected according to the SC. The model is controlled by free parameters including global coupling (G) as well as local excitatory-to-excitatory (wEE) and inhibitory-to-excitatory (wIE) connection weights. Given a set of parameters, the synaptic activity of neuronal ensembles was simulated for 450 seconds and converted to BOLD signal using the Balloon-Windkessel model. The simulated BOLD was used to calculate simulated FC and FCD, which were used to assess the simulation fit to empirical data. The simulations were performed based on subject-specific as well as group-averaged structural connectomes. Model optimization was performed using grid search and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (Wischnewski, 2022). For each subject, we used simulated excitatory firing rate of the nodes from the optimal simulations as the measure of excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio. Lastly, we studied age-related variation of regional E-I ratio, as well as their association with regional grey-white matter contrast as a measure of intracortical myelination. <br>Results. The simulations using group-averaged SC led to an optimal fit of 0.21±0.7 across the subjects, which was higher than the optimal goodness of fits when subject-specific SCs were used. The goodness of fit significantly decreased with age (r = -0.15, p < 0.05). We observed a significant increase of optimal G with age (r = 0.10, p<0.05) in the group-SC models but no significant age-related changes of model parameters in the subject-SC models. The regional in silico excitatory firing rates showed region-specific changes with age, with decreased firing rate in parietal and frontal regions and increased firing rate of occipital regions. Grey-white matter contrast was was positively correlated with in silico excitatory firing rates in specific regions. <br>Conclusions. Our whole-brain dynamical modeling approach revealed age-related region-specific changes of E-I ratio and its links to cortical microstructure. We observed decreased E-I ratio in frontal and parietal regions while it increased in occipital regions. This was in line with previous studies indicating decreased E-I ratio predominantly in association regions (Caballero, 2016; Larsen, 2022). We found association of grey-white matter contrast with E-I ratio, overall indicating increased inhibition with higher intracortical myelin, which was in line with findings on interactions of myelination and inhibitory activity and maturation (Stedehouder, 2017). Future work is needed to assess replicability of our findings using longitudinal samples and alternative models.},
