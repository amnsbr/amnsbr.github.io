	abstract = {<b>Background:</b> Red blood cell distribution width ({RDW}) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of circulating erythrocytes.
It has been recently identified as a prognostic marker in several diseases including acute pancreatitis ({AP}). In this systematic
review the prognostic value of {RDW} in predicting mortality of {AP} patients will be assessed.
<br>
<b>Methods:</b> {PubMed}, Scopus, {EMBASE}, and {ISI} databases were searched until September 2016 using the following search strategy:
(pancreatitis {OR} pancreatitides) {AND} ({RDW} {OR} "red cell distribution width" {OR} "red blood cell distribution width" {OR} anisocytosis).
Four authors independently reviewed the retrieved articles. Studies were included if they had evaluated the association between {RDW}
value and mortality of acute pancreatitis patients. Case reports, comments, letters to the editor, reviews, study protocols, and experimental
studies were not included. Data abstraction and quality assessment for the included studies was independently performed by
two authors. Quality of studies was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist for prognostic studies. Data
were synthesized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis was performed on the diagnostic performance of {RDW} to predict mortality in {AP}
patients.
<br>
<b>Results:</b> Seven studies (976 patients) were included in the systematic review. Six studies reported a statistically significant association
between {RDW} value and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed on four studies (487 patients) using a bivariate model and a
summary receiver operating characteristic ({sROC}) curve was plotted with an area under the curve ({AUC}) of 0.757. The pooled diagnostic
odds ratio ({DOR}), sensitivity and specificity was 19.51 (95\% {CI}: 5.26-72.30), 67\% (95\% {CI}: 51\%-80\%) and 90\% (95\% {CI}:
73\%-96\%), respectively.
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> {RDW} is an easy to use and an inexpensive marker with a moderate prognostic value to predict death in {AP} patients.
Clinicians should be more alert when a patient with {AP} has an increased {RDW}. Investigation of possible combinations of other prognostic
markers with {RDW} is recommended.},

	abstract = {Background: Inflammatory processes have been proposed in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL 1 beta (IL-1β), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) with the prognosis and functional outcome in patients with less severe ischemic stroke., 
Methods: We measured the level of IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α on days 1 and 5 after stroke onset by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The infarct volume was assessed using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and posterior circulation ASPECTS (pcASPECTS) score in brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The severity of stroke was assessed by applying the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) in 24 hours on day 5 and after 3 months from stroke onset. Good outcome was defined as the third month MRS ≤ 2. The association of inflammatory markers and the course of stroke symptoms over time was examined., 
Results: Forty-four first-ever stroke patients without concurrent inflammatory diseases with a mean age of 65 years were included. The mean NIHSS and MRS in admission time were 6.5 ± 3.5 and 3.07, respectively. The day 1 and the day 5 levels of IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α were not significantly different in good and poor outcome groups (all P-values {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, they were not significantly associated with the ASPECTS, pcASPECTS, and changes of NIHSS and MRS over time., 
Conclusion: The levels of hsCRP, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are not reliable predictors of functional outcomes in patients with less severe acute ischemic stroke (AIS).},

However, the thalamus is a heterogeneous structure and the specific thalamic subregions that are involved in this condition are unclear. Here, we used thalamic shape analysis for the detailed localization of thalamic abnormalities in MSrF. Using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, we measured fatigue in 42 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The thalamic shape was extracted from T1w images using an automated pipeline. We investigated the association of thalamic surface deviations with the severity of global fatigue and its cognitive, physical and psychosocial subdomains. Cognitive fatigue was correlated with an inward deformity of the left anteromedial thalamic surface, but no other localized shape deviation was observed in correlation with global, physical or psychosocial fatigue. Our findings indicate that the left anteromedial thalamic subregions are implicated in cognitive fatigue, possibly through their role in reward processing and cognitive and executive functions.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging and genetics studies have advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of sleep and its disorders. However, individual studies usually have limitations to identifying consistent and reproducible effects, including modest sample sizes, heterogeneous clinical characteristics and varied methodologies. These issues call for a large-scale multi-centre effort in sleep research, in order to increase the number of samples, and harmonize the methods of data collection, preprocessing and analysis using pre-registered well-established protocols. The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium provides a powerful collaborative framework for combining datasets across individual sites. Recently, we have launched the ENIGMA-Sleep working group with the collaboration of several institutes from 15 countries to perform large-scale worldwide neuroimaging and genetics studies for better understanding the neurobiology of impaired sleep quality in population-based healthy individuals, the neural consequences of sleep deprivation, pathophysiology of sleep disorders, as well as neural correlates of sleep disturbances across various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this introductory review, we describe the details of our currently available datasets and our ongoing projects in the ENIGMA-Sleep group, and discuss both the potential challenges and opportunities of a collaborative initiative in sleep medicine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in infants with confirmed COVID-19 infection by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5\% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43\%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60\%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8\%), consolidation (28.57\%), nodule (18.57\%), effusion (7.14\%) and focal lucency (7.14\%).
CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants' chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group. Other chest CT scan manifestations can be classified as typical COVID-19 infection (peripheral GGO), lobar pneumonia (consolidation) and opportunistic infections (pulmonary nodules).},

	abstract = {Background and Aims. Visceral adiposity index (VAI) is a novel marker of fat distribution and function which incorporates both anthropometric and laboratory measures. Recently, several studies have suggested VAI as a screening tool for metabolic syndrome (MetS). Here, we aimed to consolidate the results of these studies by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods and Results. We searched PubMed and EMBASE online databases for eligible studies that investigated the association of VAI and MetS. After reviewing 294 records, we included 33 eligible papers with a sum of 20516 MetS and 53242 healthy participants. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed, and the relevant data was extracted. All included studies reported a significant association between VAI and MetS screening, but were highly heterogeneous in their reported effects. We pooled the diagnostic test accuracy metrics of VAI for MetS screening and showed that it has a moderate-to-high accuracy with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.847, a pooled sensitivity of 78\%, and a pooled specificity of 79\%. Besides, we pooled the difference in means of VAI between patients with MetS and healthy controls, revealing that VAI was 2.15 units higher in MetS patients. Conclusions. VAI is an accurate, low-cost, and widely available screening marker for MetS. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its applicability in clinical practice, determine an optimal cut-off, and identify populations that would benefit the most from it.},

Here, we provide a quantitative consolidation of neuroimaging in late-life depression using coordinate-based meta-analysis by searching multiple databases up to March 2020. Our search revealed 3252 unique records, among which we identified 32 eligible whole-brain neuroimaging publications comparing 674 patients with 568 controls. The peak coordinates of group comparisons between the patients and the controls were extracted and then analyzed using activation likelihood estimation method. Our sufficiently powered analysis on all the experiments, and more homogenous subsections of the data (patients {\textgreater} controls, controls {\textgreater} patients, and functional imaging experiments) revealed no significant convergent regional abnormality in late-life depression. This inconsistency might be due to clinical and biological heterogeneity of LLD, as well as experimental (e.g., choice of tasks, image modalities) and analytic flexibility (e.g., preprocessing and analytic parameters), and distributed patterns of neural abnormalities. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical/biological heterogeneity of late-life depression, in addition to the need for more reproducible research by using pre-registered and standardized protocols on more homogenous populations to identify potential consistent brain abnormalities in late-life depression.},
