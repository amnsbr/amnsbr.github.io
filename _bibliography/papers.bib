	abstract = {<b>Background:</b> Red blood cell distribution width ({RDW}) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of circulating erythrocytes.
It has been recently identified as a prognostic marker in several diseases including acute pancreatitis ({AP}). In this systematic
review the prognostic value of {RDW} in predicting mortality of {AP} patients will be assessed.
<br>
<b>Methods:</b> {PubMed}, Scopus, {EMBASE}, and {ISI} databases were searched until September 2016 using the following search strategy:
(pancreatitis {OR} pancreatitides) {AND} ({RDW} {OR} "red cell distribution width" {OR} "red blood cell distribution width" {OR} anisocytosis).
Four authors independently reviewed the retrieved articles. Studies were included if they had evaluated the association between {RDW}
value and mortality of acute pancreatitis patients. Case reports, comments, letters to the editor, reviews, study protocols, and experimental
studies were not included. Data abstraction and quality assessment for the included studies was independently performed by
two authors. Quality of studies was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist for prognostic studies. Data
were synthesized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis was performed on the diagnostic performance of {RDW} to predict mortality in {AP}
patients.
<br>
<b>Results:</b> Seven studies (976 patients) were included in the systematic review. Six studies reported a statistically significant association
between {RDW} value and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed on four studies (487 patients) using a bivariate model and a
summary receiver operating characteristic ({sROC}) curve was plotted with an area under the curve ({AUC}) of 0.757. The pooled diagnostic
odds ratio ({DOR}), sensitivity and specificity was 19.51 (95\% {CI}: 5.26-72.30), 67\% (95\% {CI}: 51\%-80\%) and 90\% (95\% {CI}:
73\%-96\%), respectively.
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> {RDW} is an easy to use and an inexpensive marker with a moderate prognostic value to predict death in {AP} patients.
Clinicians should be more alert when a patient with {AP} has an increased {RDW}. Investigation of possible combinations of other prognostic
markers with {RDW} is recommended.},

	abstract = {Background: Inflammatory processes have been proposed in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL 1 beta (IL-1β), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) with the prognosis and functional outcome in patients with less severe ischemic stroke., 
Methods: We measured the level of IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α on days 1 and 5 after stroke onset by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The infarct volume was assessed using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and posterior circulation ASPECTS (pcASPECTS) score in brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The severity of stroke was assessed by applying the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) in 24 hours on day 5 and after 3 months from stroke onset. Good outcome was defined as the third month MRS ≤ 2. The association of inflammatory markers and the course of stroke symptoms over time was examined., 
Results: Forty-four first-ever stroke patients without concurrent inflammatory diseases with a mean age of 65 years were included. The mean NIHSS and MRS in admission time were 6.5 ± 3.5 and 3.07, respectively. The day 1 and the day 5 levels of IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α were not significantly different in good and poor outcome groups (all P-values {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, they were not significantly associated with the ASPECTS, pcASPECTS, and changes of NIHSS and MRS over time., 
Conclusion: The levels of hsCRP, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are not reliable predictors of functional outcomes in patients with less severe acute ischemic stroke (AIS).},

However, the thalamus is a heterogeneous structure and the specific thalamic subregions that are involved in this condition are unclear. Here, we used thalamic shape analysis for the detailed localization of thalamic abnormalities in MSrF. Using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, we measured fatigue in 42 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The thalamic shape was extracted from T1w images using an automated pipeline. We investigated the association of thalamic surface deviations with the severity of global fatigue and its cognitive, physical and psychosocial subdomains. Cognitive fatigue was correlated with an inward deformity of the left anteromedial thalamic surface, but no other localized shape deviation was observed in correlation with global, physical or psychosocial fatigue. Our findings indicate that the left anteromedial thalamic subregions are implicated in cognitive fatigue, possibly through their role in reward processing and cognitive and executive functions.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging and genetics studies have advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of sleep and its disorders. However, individual studies usually have limitations to identifying consistent and reproducible effects, including modest sample sizes, heterogeneous clinical characteristics and varied methodologies. These issues call for a large-scale multi-centre effort in sleep research, in order to increase the number of samples, and harmonize the methods of data collection, preprocessing and analysis using pre-registered well-established protocols. The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium provides a powerful collaborative framework for combining datasets across individual sites. Recently, we have launched the ENIGMA-Sleep working group with the collaboration of several institutes from 15 countries to perform large-scale worldwide neuroimaging and genetics studies for better understanding the neurobiology of impaired sleep quality in population-based healthy individuals, the neural consequences of sleep deprivation, pathophysiology of sleep disorders, as well as neural correlates of sleep disturbances across various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this introductory review, we describe the details of our currently available datasets and our ongoing projects in the ENIGMA-Sleep group, and discuss both the potential challenges and opportunities of a collaborative initiative in sleep medicine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in infants with confirmed COVID-19 infection by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5\% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43\%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60\%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8\%), consolidation (28.57\%), nodule (18.57\%), effusion (7.14\%) and focal lucency (7.14\%).
CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants' chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group. Other chest CT scan manifestations can be classified as typical COVID-19 infection (peripheral GGO), lobar pneumonia (consolidation) and opportunistic infections (pulmonary nodules).},

	abstract = {Background and Aims. Visceral adiposity index (VAI) is a novel marker of fat distribution and function which incorporates both anthropometric and laboratory measures. Recently, several studies have suggested VAI as a screening tool for metabolic syndrome (MetS). Here, we aimed to consolidate the results of these studies by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods and Results. We searched PubMed and EMBASE online databases for eligible studies that investigated the association of VAI and MetS. After reviewing 294 records, we included 33 eligible papers with a sum of 20516 MetS and 53242 healthy participants. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed, and the relevant data was extracted. All included studies reported a significant association between VAI and MetS screening, but were highly heterogeneous in their reported effects. We pooled the diagnostic test accuracy metrics of VAI for MetS screening and showed that it has a moderate-to-high accuracy with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.847, a pooled sensitivity of 78\%, and a pooled specificity of 79\%. Besides, we pooled the difference in means of VAI between patients with MetS and healthy controls, revealing that VAI was 2.15 units higher in MetS patients. Conclusions. VAI is an accurate, low-cost, and widely available screening marker for MetS. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its applicability in clinical practice, determine an optimal cut-off, and identify populations that would benefit the most from it.},

Here, we provide a quantitative consolidation of neuroimaging in late-life depression using coordinate-based meta-analysis by searching multiple databases up to March 2020. Our search revealed 3252 unique records, among which we identified 32 eligible whole-brain neuroimaging publications comparing 674 patients with 568 controls. The peak coordinates of group comparisons between the patients and the controls were extracted and then analyzed using activation likelihood estimation method. Our sufficiently powered analysis on all the experiments, and more homogenous subsections of the data (patients {\textgreater} controls, controls {\textgreater} patients, and functional imaging experiments) revealed no significant convergent regional abnormality in late-life depression. This inconsistency might be due to clinical and biological heterogeneity of LLD, as well as experimental (e.g., choice of tasks, image modalities) and analytic flexibility (e.g., preprocessing and analytic parameters), and distributed patterns of neural abnormalities. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical/biological heterogeneity of late-life depression, in addition to the need for more reproducible research by using pre-registered and standardized protocols on more homogenous populations to identify potential consistent brain abnormalities in late-life depression.},

Preclinical studies suggest that curcumin might be a potential neuroprotective agent in Parkinson's disease (PD). This clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding nanomicelle curcumin on improving the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients and their quality of life.
Material and methods
Idiopathic PD patients aged ≥30 whose symptoms were under control were included in this pilot, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either the curcumin (n= 30, 80mg/day) or placebo (n= 30) groups and were followed for nine months. Primary outcomes were the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). These variables, along with demographic data, drug history, and possible side effects of curcumin, were gathered at the beginning of the study and every three months. A mixed effects model was used to compare the group-by-time interaction, followed by post hoc analysis.
Results
Although the mean MDS-UPDRS and PDQ-39 scores were not significantly different between the curcumin and placebo groups at any time points, MDS-UPDRS part III (P=0.04) showed a significant difference in its overall trend between the study groups. However, post hoc analysis failed to spot this difference at study time points. The most common side effects of curcumin were nausea and vomiting (P=0.25) and gastroesophageal reflux (P=0.42).
Conclusion
While curcumin is a well-tolerated natural compound, this trial was unsuccessful in showing its efficacy in quality of life and clinical symptoms of PD patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION Hippocampal local and network dysfunction is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS We characterized the spatial patterns of hippocampus differentiation based on brain co-metabolism in healthy elderly participants and demonstrated their relevance to study local metabolic changes and associated dysfunction in pathological aging. RESULTS The hippocampus can be differentiated into anterior/posterior and dorsal cornu ammonis (CA)/ventral (subiculum) subregions. While anterior/posterior CA show co-metabolism with different regions of the subcortical limbic networks, the anterior/posterior subiculum are parts of cortical networks supporting object-centered memory and higher cognitive demands, respectively. Both networks show relationships with the spatial patterns of gene expression pertaining to cell energy metabolism and AD's process. Finally, while local metabolism is generally lower in posterior regions, the anterior–posterior imbalance is maximal in late mild cognitive impairment with the anterior subiculum being relatively preserved. DISCUSSION Future studies should consider bidimensional hippocampal differentiation and in particular the posterior subicular region to better understand pathological aging.},

	abstract = {The human isocortex consists of tangentially organized layers with unique cytoarchitectural properties. These layers show spatial variations in thickness and cytoarchitecture across the neocortex, which is thought to support function through enabling targeted corticocortical connections. Here, leveraging maps of the 6 cortical layers based on 3D human brain histology, we aimed to quantitatively characterize the systematic covariation of laminar structure in the cortex and its functional consequences. After correcting for the effect of cortical curvature, we identified a spatial pattern of changes in laminar thickness covariance from lateral frontal to posterior occipital regions, which differentiated the dominance of infra- versus supragranular layer thickness. Corresponding to the laminar regularities of cortical connections along cortical hierarchy, the infragranular-dominant pattern of laminar thickness was associated with higher hierarchical positions of regions, mapped based on resting-state effective connectivity in humans and tract-tracing of structural connections in macaques. Moreover, we show that regions with similar laminar thickness patterns have a higher likelihood of structural connections and strength of functional connections. In sum, here, we characterize the organization of laminar thickness in the human isocortex and its association with cortico-cortical connectivity, illustrating how laminar organization may provide a foundational principle of cortical function.},

	abstract = {Insomnia symptoms are prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN).We selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC), testing the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression across each network and ROI. Finally, we correlated observed abnormalities with changes in cognitive and affective scores.Insomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. Within-group analyses revealed that in CN and MCI, insomnia symptoms were characterised by within-network hyperconnectivity, while in AD, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was ubiquitous. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN of AD individuals. Abnormal FC within and between DMN and CEN hubs was additionally associated with reduced cognitive function across all groups, and increased depressive symptoms in AD.We conclude that patients with clinical AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.},

	abstract = {Determining sex-bias in brain structure is of great societal interest to improve diagnostics and treatment of brain-related disorders. So far, studies on sex-bias in brain structure predominantly focus on macro-scale measures, and often ignore factors determining this bias. Here we study sex-bias in cortical and hippocampal microstructure in relation to sex hormones. Investigating quantitative intracortical profiling in-vivo using the T1w/T2w ratio in 1093 healthy females and males of the cross-sectional Human Connectome Project young adult sample, we find that regional cortical and hippocampal microstructure differs between males and females and that the effect size of this sex-bias varies depending on self-reported hormonal status in females. Microstructural sex-bias and expression of sex hormone genes, based on an independent post-mortem sample, are spatially coupled. Lastly, sex-bias is most pronounced in paralimbic\&nbsp;areas, with low laminar complexity, which are predicted to be most plastic based on their cytoarchitectural properties. Albeit correlative, our study underscores the importance of incorporating sex hormone variables into the investigation of brain structure and plasticity. Here, the authors demonstrate that cortical microstructure in young adults shows marked sex bias, which is\&nbsp;most pronounced in paralimbic areas. The effects are put into context with variations in sex hormones and local cytoarchitecture.},

	abstract = {Human brain morphology undergoes complex changes over the lifespan. Despite recent progress in tracking brain development via normative models, current knowledge of underlying biological mechanisms is highly limited. We demonstrate that human cortical thickness development and aging trajectories unfold along patterns of molecular and cellular brain organization, traceable from population-level to individual developmental trajectories. During childhood and adolescence, cortex-wide spatial distributions of dopaminergic receptors, inhibitory neurons, glial cell populations, and brain-metabolic features explain up to 50\% of the variance associated with a lifespan model of regional cortical thickness trajectories. In contrast, modeled cortical thickness change patterns during adulthood are best explained by cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. These relationships are supported by developmental gene expression trajectories and translate to individual longitudinal data from over 8000 adolescents, explaining up to 59\% of developmental change at cohort- and 18\% at single-subject level. Integrating neurobiological brain atlases with normative modeling and population neuroimaging provides a biologically meaningful path to understand brain development and aging in living humans.},

Here, we probe layer-specific microstructural asymmetry using one post-mortem male brain. Overall, anterior and posterior regions show leftward and rightward asymmetry respectively, but this pattern varies across cortical layers. A similar anterior-posterior pattern is observed using in vivo Human Connectome Project (N = 1101) T1w/T2w microstructural data, with average cortical asymmetry showing the strongest similarity with post-mortem-based asymmetry of layer III. Moreover, microstructural asymmetry is found to be heritable, varies as a function of age and sex, and corresponds to intrinsic functional asymmetry. We also observe a differential association of language and markers of mental health with microstructural asymmetry patterns at the individual level, illustrating a functional divergence between inferior-superior and anterior-posterior microstructural axes, possibly anchored in development. Last, we could show concordant evidence with alternative in vivo microstructural measures: magnetization transfer (N = 286) and quantitative T1 (N = 50). Together, our study highlights microstructural asymmetry in the human cortex and its functional and behavioral relevance.},
