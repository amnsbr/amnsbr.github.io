	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have reported brain alterations in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, they pointed to inconsistent findings. 
METHODS: We used a meta-analytic approach to identify the convergent structural and functional brain abnormalities in bvFTD. Following the best-practice neuroimaging meta-analysis guidelines, we searched PubMed and Embase databases and performed reference tracking. Then, the coordinates of group comparisons between bvFTD and controls from 73 studies were extracted and tested for convergence using activation likelihood estimation. 
RESULTS: We identified convergent abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortices, anterior insula, amygdala, paracingulate, striatum, and hippocampus. Task-based and resting-state functional connectivity pointed to the joint networks that are connected to the obtained consistent regions. Functional decoding analyses suggested associated dysfunction of emotional processing, interoception, reward processing, higher-order cognitive functions, olfactory and gustatory perceptions in bvFTD.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted a key role of the salience network and subcortical regions in the pathophysiology of bvFTD.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/y3n4a},
	abstract = {Several neuroimaging studies have investigated localized aberrations in brain structure, function or connectivity in late-life depression, but the ensuing results are equivocal and often conflicting. Here, we provide a quantitative consolidation of neuroimaging in late-life depression using coordinate-based meta-analysis by searching multiple databases and tracing the relevant references up to March 2020. Our search revealed 3252 unique records, among which we identified 32 eligible whole-brain neuroimaging publications comparing 674 late-life depression patients with 568 healthy controls. The peak coordinates of group comparisons between patients and controls were extracted and then analyzed using activation likelihood estimation method. Our sufficiently powered analysis on all the experiments, and more homogenous subsections of the data (in-/decreases, experiments using functional imaging) revealed no significant convergent regional abnormality in late-life depression. This inconsistency might be due to experimental (e.g., choice of tasks, image modalities) and analytic flexibility (e.g., preprocessing and analytic parameters), distributed patterns of neural abnormalities, and heterogeneity of clinical populations (e.g., severity of late-life depression, age of onset). Our findings highlight the need for more reproducible research by using pre-registered and standardized protocols on more homogenous populations to identify potential consistent brain abnormalities in late-life depression.},

	abstract = {The human neocortex consists of tangentially organized layers with unique cytoarchitectural properties. These layers show spatial variations in thickness and cytoarchitecture across the neocortex, which is thought to support brain function through enabling targeted corticocortical connections. Here, leveraging maps of the six cortical layers in 3D human brain histology, we aimed to quantitatively characterize the systematic covariation of laminar structure in the cortex and its functional consequences. After correcting for the effect of cortical curvature, we identified a spatial pattern of changes in laminar thickness covariance from lateral frontal to posterior occipital regions, which differentiated the dominance of infra- versus supragranular layer thickness. Corresponding to the laminar regularities of cortical connections along cortical hierarchy, the infragranular-dominant pattern of laminar thickness was associated with higher hierarchical positions of regions, mapped based on resting-state effective connectivity in humans and tract-tracing of structural connections in macaques. Moreover, we show that regions with comparable laminar thickness patterns correspond to inter-regional structural covariance, maturational coupling, and transcriptomic patterning, indicating developmental relevance. In sum, here we characterize the association between organization of laminar thickness and processing hierarchy, anchored in ontogeny. As such, we illustrate how laminar organization may provide a foundational principle ultimately supporting human cognitive functioning.},

	abstract = {Human brain morphology undergoes complex developmental changes with diverse regional trajectories. Various biological factors influence cortical thickness development, but human data are scarce. Building on methodological advances in neuroimaging of large cohorts, we show that population-based developmental trajectories of cortical thickness unfold along patterns of molecular and cellular brain organization. During childhood and adolescence, distributions of dopaminergic receptors, inhibitory neurons, glial cell populations as well as features of brain metabolism explain up to 50\% of variance associated with regional cortical thickness trajectories. Cortical maturation patterns in later life are best explained by distributions of cholinergic and glutamatergic systems. These observations are validated in longitudinal data from over 8,000 adolescents, explaining up to 59\% of developmental change at population- and 18\% at single-subject level. Integrating multilevel brain atlases with normative modeling and population neuroimaging provides a biologically and clinically meaningful path to understand typical and atypical brain development in living humans.},

	abstract = {Sex hormone receptors are expressed widely in both neurons and glial cells, which allows them to interact with the brain’s major cell groups via several molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms lead to sex differences in brain structure as well as hormone-induced plasticity in the female brain across the menstrual cycle. Adding to the literature on volumetric changes in cortical structure, here we set out to investigate sex differences in the microstructure of the human cortex in relation to sex hormones. We assessed regional variation in cortical microstructure as a function of sex, hormonal status and sex hormone receptor gene expression distribution based on quantitative intracortical profiling in vivo using the magnetic resonance imaging based T1w/T2w ratio in 992 healthy females and males of the Human Connectome Project young adult sample. We demonstrate that microstructure in isocortex and hippocampus differs regionally between males and females, that this effect varies with hormone levels of females and that implicated brain regions overlap with estrogen receptor and sex steroid synthesis gene expression. Lastly, we show that sex and sex hormone related brain structure variations are most pronounced in areas of low laminar cortical complexity (agranular cortex), which are also predicted to be most plastic based on their cytoarchitectural properties. Together, our data thus are suggestive of sex differences in cortical and hippocampal microstructure, as well as the modulatory function of sex hormones on these measures. Albeit correlative, this study underscores the importance of incorporating sex hormone variables into the investigation of brain structure and plasticity.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems. Through a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we re-viewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps. We found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters. Our findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.},

	abstract = {Background: Insomnia is prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Methods: We selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC) , and functional connectivity (FC). We tested the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index across groups. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression for each network. Finally, we correlated brain abnormalities with cognitive scores. Results: Insomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. In the CN and MCI groups, insomnia symptoms were characterized by patterns of within-network hyperconnectivity, while in the AD group, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was observed. FC alterations within and between DMN and CEN hubs were associated with reduced MMSE scores in each of the groups. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN for AD individuals. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affect the intrinsic functional organization of the three networks along the AD trajectory. Patients with AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.},

	abstract = {The human thalamus is a bilateral and heterogeneous grey matter structure that plays a crucial role in coordinating whole-brain activity. Investigations of its complex structural and functional internal organization revealed to a certain degree overlapping parcellations, however, a consensus on thalamic subnuclei boundaries remains absent. Recent work suggests that thalamic organization might additionally reflect continuous axes transcending nuclear boundaries. In this study, we used a multimodal approach to uncover how low-dimensional axes that describe thalamic connectivity patterns to the cortex are related to internal thalamic microstructural features, functional connectivity, and structural covariance. We computed a thalamocortical structural connectome via probabilistic tractography on diffusion MRI and derived two main axes of thalamic organization. The principal thalamic gradient, extending from medial to lateral and differentiating between transmodal and unimodal nuclei, was related to intrathalamic myelin profiles, and patterns of functional connectivity, while the secondary axis showed correspondence to core-matrix cell type distributions. Lastly, exploring multimodal thalamocortical associations on a global scale, we observed that the medial-to- lateral gradient consistently differentiated limbic, frontoparietal, and default mode network nodes from dorsal and ventral attention networks across modalities. However, the link with sensory modalities varied. In sum, we show the coherence between lower dimensional patterns of thalamocortical structural connectivity and various modalities, shedding light on multiscale thalamic organization.},
