	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have reported brain alterations in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, they pointed to inconsistent findings. 
METHODS: We used a meta-analytic approach to identify the convergent structural and functional brain abnormalities in bvFTD. Following the best-practice neuroimaging meta-analysis guidelines, we searched PubMed and Embase databases and performed reference tracking. Then, the coordinates of group comparisons between bvFTD and controls from 73 studies were extracted and tested for convergence using activation likelihood estimation. 
RESULTS: We identified convergent abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortices, anterior insula, amygdala, paracingulate, striatum, and hippocampus. Task-based and resting-state functional connectivity pointed to the joint networks that are connected to the obtained consistent regions. Functional decoding analyses suggested associated dysfunction of emotional processing, interoception, reward processing, higher-order cognitive functions, olfactory and gustatory perceptions in bvFTD.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted a key role of the salience network and subcortical regions in the pathophysiology of bvFTD.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/y3n4a},
	abstract = {Several neuroimaging studies have investigated localized aberrations in brain structure, function or connectivity in late-life depression, but the ensuing results are equivocal and often conflicting. Here, we provide a quantitative consolidation of neuroimaging in late-life depression using coordinate-based meta-analysis by searching multiple databases and tracing the relevant references up to March 2020. Our search revealed 3252 unique records, among which we identified 32 eligible whole-brain neuroimaging publications comparing 674 late-life depression patients with 568 healthy controls. The peak coordinates of group comparisons between patients and controls were extracted and then analyzed using activation likelihood estimation method. Our sufficiently powered analysis on all the experiments, and more homogenous subsections of the data (in-/decreases, experiments using functional imaging) revealed no significant convergent regional abnormality in late-life depression. This inconsistency might be due to experimental (e.g., choice of tasks, image modalities) and analytic flexibility (e.g., preprocessing and analytic parameters), distributed patterns of neural abnormalities, and heterogeneity of clinical populations (e.g., severity of late-life depression, age of onset). Our findings highlight the need for more reproducible research by using pre-registered and standardized protocols on more homogenous populations to identify potential consistent brain abnormalities in late-life depression.},
